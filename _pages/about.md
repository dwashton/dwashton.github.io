Hi, I'm Dave Ashton.  I'm a software developer, meetup organizer, speaker, sports fan, husband and father of two.

Professionally I am a software engineer, system architect, and a development team lead, working in the Smart Cities / Intelligent Transportation Systems field. I have a broad range of experience and interest across many frameworks and toolsets, with most of my time these days spent developing in .NET.

I also lead the [Silicon Halton Software Peer2Peer Meetup Group][p2p], a local meetup for software developers in the Halton area (just west of Toronto, Ontario) to chat about software development topics, without a specific tech stack focus. 

Please feel free to message me on Twitter or if you're in the Greater Toronto Area check out our software meetup!
