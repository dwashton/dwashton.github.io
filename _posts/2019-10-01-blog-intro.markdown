Well, isn't this fun!

I've decided to start a blog, because I would like to do more writing and this seemed like the best way to accomplish that.

Please know, I'm just writing here for fun.

I can't guarantee that every post will be generally useful... I can't guarantee that any post will be useful!  Some posts may cover software development topics, and some may just be random musings or unrelated topics.  If you like something useful here, then great!  If you find it tedious then thanks for reading and have a nice day... no worries. 

Here's an example of a useless function, just so I can see the formatting style:

{% highlight cs %}

public static int Increment(this int obj) 
{
	return obj++;
}

{% endhighlight %}

And here's a [link][testlink], also for styling purposes.

And there we go!
